I started to look around for someone to give me inspiration. Some chick (she iight) has a really Shiney nose.
It doesn't make much sense but whatever.
I guess if she's a brown noser she may as well lube up, but I digress.
Ever wonder why people try to rush into a train by standing right in front of the fucking door as if that'll help them get into the train first or in the train in the first place?
It's like, "Listen here motherfuckers, let me the fuck out or you unloved bastards will have to enter through another door. And the first mofo to try to test me will be made an example of". Ok well maybe in my mind and world I'd like to be honest like that, but these fuckers would end up dead if i got to that point, but yet again I digress.
So logic... 😐 wtf is that? Cause not many people has what I define as logic.
Soo... you're on a narrow pathway on the train platform... hmm I think standing right where everyone has to pass is an amazing idea
Another thing, wtf is up with people and their lack of self awareness? Like holy fucking jack rabbit 🐰. Who is giving birth to these morons? Maybe I'm just being cruel or maybe they need to be tested at birth and if they fail leave it up to survival of the fittest.
Not I have this one person that I had to nudge to allow people onto the train... 😐 bruh all that space and you fail to realize that your a choking point? (The deadpool side of me says that he earned someone choking him (me 😄), but logic is strong in this one.)
So after the guy figures out what I'm saying since he has music blasting in his ears although his awareness sucks, this chick comes in ti the train and tries to play badass by not holding onto anything. Till she nearly busted her ass when the train stopped. It's truly a mesmerizing thing to behold.
But anyway, crossing the Manhattan bridge is awesome, at least until one day (insert crazy prediction here)
Lmfao!!!! 😂😂😂😂
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼YASSSS
