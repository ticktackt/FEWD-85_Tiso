     <h2><a href="#">How I implemented Relaxr in 2 weeks and changed my life.</a></h2>
          
      <p> So.. I don't think I'm a bad person. At least I could be, but I choose not to go down that path. And I believe that we all have that choice. Sometimes I think certain situations arise to test us, but more so to test if we've embodied the very things we hold dear. We all have our own "code of honor" that guides us through life and the codes in that book can change from time to time. But how often and how many of those code connect to us on such a level that it becomes part our instincts?
All of these thoughts spawned from an event that just happened.. I got off the train to transfer to another train which would arrive on the other side of the platform. As I stood waiting on the platform I noticed a little girl in a wheel chair. To the side of her seemed to be her sister and behind her was her mother. I only took a glance, there wasn't anything special or anything to stare about. She probably gets enough of that when other people look at her and wonder what's "wrong" with her. But that's not the part that tripped me up. What tripped me up is when the mother walked up to the staircase and began to tug her daughter up the stairs all alone. Everyone including myself, just stood and either glanced or watched as the mother, short and chubby, found the strength to pull her daughter up. I'm sure the thought of lending a hand or even something simple as asking if she'd like assistance, crossed mind of everyone there assistance it did mine. But.. the scary part is that no one did...
I mean, surly I've been in situation where I'd "like help" but didn't need it. So I never bothered to ask. But were each of us wrong for not lending a hand without being asked?
Did we have to stand there and just watch, pretend that the opportunity to help another isn't right in front of us, or think "she got this, she'll be iight"?
I'm my head, the only think I was thinking was "why does it seem like I'm frozen by the thought of just actively lending a hand when by my code, it's the logical and right thing to do?".
How many opportunities pass by where we miss the chance to do something "right" but instead of acting on what we believe, we turn a blind eye or throw the thought of the situation away?
I guess it bothers me this way because, in a sense I feel as though I've failed that mother and her child as well as become a hypocrite to my own ideals.
And really and truly, I think these thoughts with a heavy heart. The fact is, my lack of action was action enough to show me the error in my ways. Yet another test that I've failed. Although, i know im only human and I'll always make mistakes from time to time, I hope that I don't fail a test that could potentially spell the death or cause pain of someone where I had an opportunity to prevent.
For all I knew.. in the moment, that mother could have had a cramp or slipped and who knows if i would have been able to make it in time to prevent her daughter from falling out of her wheelchair... they say there're different dimensions where different choices were made and because of these small choices, there's drastically different time lines. I don't know what timeline I may be in, but if each small action has weight to how this world turns out, I hope that I choose wisely and stay true to myself and my ideals, because without being true to myself, I could never be true to this world.
