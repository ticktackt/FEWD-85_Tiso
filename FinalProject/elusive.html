     <h2><a href="blogcontentpage.html">"An Elusive Common Sense?"</a></h2>

     <p> So I got on the N train. Doors open and there's this cute Indian chick standing there. Real cute.. 😐.. (idc side taking over)... she iight.
She had me for 5 seconds and then she got blurred out. How unfortunate.
But is that my loss... or hers?.... will I feel regretful about not saying something? Am I feeling that way now?....
NOPE I don't give a ffffuuuuuuccccckkkkkkk.
*yawn*
So the dude she was talking to was a old dude, but the reason I bring him up isn't because he was competition, it's because the fucktard was standing in my way and I didn't like it. So I went all deep voice on him from behind and said excuse me in a nice but death threatening way 😊
She moved him out of the way, so I saw a slimmer of potential in her. But as I said before she became a blur.
Side note: why do some girls like that nose ring thing that makes them look like a bull from old school cartoons?
Imo, that shit ain't cute.
Maybe that's just me and I'm entitled to my own opinion just like everyone else. But I'm still fucking awesome 😂
Just saying that for the record because the people I meet and really like have to be at least as awesome as me for me to care much 😉 A.K.A, you're super awesome.
😂😂
I wonder what it's like to jump off a mountain in a squirrel suit... 😐 probably flying squirrel like?
Or is it more like a bird that can't flap it's wings, so it's gliding down hoping that a plane or car doesn't demolish it on the way down to earth
Is it possible for me to be a down to earth person if I'm tall?</p>
