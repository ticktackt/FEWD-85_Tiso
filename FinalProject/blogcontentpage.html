      <p> 
So I've been waiting on a train for about 15 mins until it finally showed up. As I'm standing near the steps, something hits the back of my head. As I turn around I see an old man walking down the stairs apologizing, (I didn't truly have a clue about what he was actually saying, but he seemed apologetic #meh), I then looked down to see what actually hit me...</p>

      <p>So.. I don't think I'm a bad person. At least I could be, but I choose not to go down that path. And I believe that we all have that choice. Sometimes I think certain situations arise to test us, but more so to test if we've embodied the very things we hold dear. We all have our own "code of honor" that guides us through life and the codes in that book can change from time to time. But how often and how many of those code connect to us on such a level that it becomes part our instincts?</p>

    <h2><a href="#"><img src="images/images.jpg">"An Elusive Common Sense"?</a></h2>

    <p>So I got on the N train. Doors open and there's this cute chick standing there. Real cute.. üòê.. (idc side taking over)... she iight.
    She had me for 5 seconds and then she got blurred out. How unfortunate.
    But is that my loss... or hers?.... will I feel regretful about not saying something? Am I feeling that way now?....
    NOPE I don't give a ffffuuuuuuccccckkkkkkk.
